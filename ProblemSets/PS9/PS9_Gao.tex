\section{Question 5}
the observation is 404

\section{Question 6}
Optimal Lambda was found to be lambda = 0.0102
The in sample RMSE was = 0.180153
The out of sample RMSE = 0.1682971

\section{Question 7}
The new optimal value of lambda = 0.0964
The in sample RMSE was =  0.1724076
The out of sample RMSE = 0.1637085

\section{Question8}
The new optimal value of lambda = 0.214
The in sample RMSE was = 0.180299
The out of sample RMSE = 0.1697518

I prefer choose the LASSO model.

\section{Question9}
the reason why i would not be able to estimate a simple linear regression model on the housing.train dataframe is the data is non-linear.
the values of RMSE are similar in the past 3 questions. The variance is low in the model.
